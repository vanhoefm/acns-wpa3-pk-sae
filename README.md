# ACNS'23: A Security Analysis of WPA3-PK: Implementation and Precomputation Attacks

- For the studied password generation implementations, see [code-pkgen](code-pkgen).

- For the rainbow table code, see [rainbow](rainbow).

- For the password collision code, see [collisions](collisions).

For interal documentation: the above are exports of [`saepk-rainbow`](https://github.com/vanhoefm/saepk-rainbow) and [`saepk-collisions`](https://github.com/vanhoefm/saepk-collisions) and correspond to a snapshot of the code as used for the experiments in the paper. This exported code will only recieve updates to clarify instructions or fix usability bugs.
